# ODC-U can help drive adoption of ODC-R

As soon as a user enters the URL of a dataset, if it is listed in the ODC-R we can automatically bring some of the related information into the ODC-U.

However, there will be many datasets in the user list that are **not** in the released list. ODI could automatically contact the data provider when it’s technically possible or provide the community of open data users with a list of datasets that don’t match. If ODI does not have enough info to contact the provider, ODI could ask users of the data to provide contact info.

Send email from Tim Berners-Lee, perhaps with a link to a video of him explaining the importance of the ODC, to providers without ODCs.

User-provided data sets will want to verify if live and conform to set of standards. Ask users of open data three times a year to confirm that it’s still available, reliable, etc. Crowd-source. Reward might be an extended directory listing (vs having to pay $25 per year).
