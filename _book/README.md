The Open Data Institute (ODI) is an independent, non-profit, non-partisan, limited by guarantee company, created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in London to catalysing the evolution of a global open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value.

###What is an Open data certificate?

Is a certificate for organizations that are releasing data and this is ‘essentially’ a badge that links to a description of your open data.

The description explores things like how often it's updated, what format it's in, who and where it came from, how realiable the information is, its quality, etc.

###What is this project building?

To complement the Open Data Certificate for organizations that are releasing data (ODC-R), we propose an ODC for users of open data (ODC-U). This will have attributes similar to the ODC-R and should be free to any project that uses open data. We expect that this certificate will be readily adopted and might help pave the way for widespread use of the ODC-Rs.

Besides specifying how an ODC-U will be created via the ODI website, we also propose defining meta data that will make it possible for search engines to find sites that use open data with accompanying search facets.
